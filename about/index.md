# EAT PALESTINE
## That Year We Tried To Recreate My Mom's Recipes

### Hi Friends.

This little site your perusing on your favorite device's screen came together like many things we get involved with - a bit of desperation and a healthy dose of naive confidence that is seemingly necessary to ever begin just about any venture. Also like most things, it revealed itself to be a project that not only showed how much more involved and difficult just about everything is in the world, but also how much skill, talent, and practice it takes to produce anything, let alone anything actually good.

One of those people who excels at making something good look easy and whom the inspiration to begin this project came from is my mom, Summer. Throughout my life she made the recipes in this book about a hundred times each, if not more, and every time it looked about as simple as filling up a glass with water. As we attempted to recreate her recipes, we quickly came to find just how difficult it really was.

Over the years, my mom has helped introduce cuisine from our family's little corner of the world to millions of people from around the world via her cooking website, [Mimi Cooks](http://www.mimicooks.com). Jonnie and I often tried our best to recreate our favorite dishes but since we were always welcome to dinners at her place which was not only easier and tastier than anything we could recreate, we never had to try that hard.

Things changed in 2013 when Jonnie and I moved to Seattle and found ourselves without easy access to my mom's dinner table. With a lot of time on our hands and not a lot of options for our favorite meals, we got the idea to put together a little recipe book for ourselves that we could share with our friends and family.

These are recipes that I mostly grew up with and I'm sure that if you ask ten Palestinians how to make any of these dishes you'll likely get ten different responses. For as small of a place Palestine is, you'll find a comically wide range of disagreements from town to town in everything from their accents and vocabulary to the ingredients they use preparing the same dishes.

You'll also notice that there are many vegetarian or vegan dishes in this book. While that's quite common for Palestinian cuisine, it's even more common at my household since my father, Mohammad, has been a strict vegetarian his whole life and so I grew up eating modified versions of a lot of the classic recipes in the book.

I hope you all get a kick out of this collection and maybe even try some of these recipes yourselves. We had fun putting it together, even if we did feel a little silly taking pictures of our food.

Thanks to Jonnie for putting up with this and so many other of my silly ideas. Like most holes I find myself digging, I couldn't have made my way out without her help.

Your friends,  

Mustafa and Jonnie
