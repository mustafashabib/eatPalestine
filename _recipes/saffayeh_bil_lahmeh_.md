*Delicious two-bite sized savory pies that are especially good with a spoon of tart yogurt on top. You can use beef, lamb, or a mixture for the meat if you prefer. We like to use a pomegranate molasses and tomato paste mixture but again you can change the ratios or omit one or the other to your tastes.*
