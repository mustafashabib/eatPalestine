### Musa'akaa
#### Layered Fried Eggplant And Tomato

*This is one of my father's favorite meals and will forever be linked to him in my mind. It's very simple to prepare but has a lot of depth and flavor. For people who think they don't like eggplant, this meal usually makes them change their mind. My dad swears by grating a potato into the sauce to thicken it up before layering.*

##### Ingredients
###### Makes 6 servings

* Black Beauty or Italian eggplant
  - 2 large
* Yellow onion
  - 1 or 2 medium
* Fresh tomato
  - 1 medium

2. Salt the eggplant slices and set them aside to drain for 15-20 minutes.
3. Heat the oil in a deep skillet and fry the slices in batches until they are golden brown and crispy.
4. Set the eggplant aside on a paper towel to drain any excess oil out of them.
5. Preheat your oven to about 350°F.
