*Although Many types of pickled vegetables are available in every market these days, pickling your own vegetables at home is a fun activity with delicious results.*

*Pickling is one way to preserve many types of seasonal vegetables to enjoy them off season. There are endless combinations of the basic parts to pickling that can impact the flavor of the vegetables: the amount of salt, vinegar, acetic acid, choosing boiled water or cold water, boiling the vegetables or just pickling them raw...*

*Pickling was used before refrigeration was invented and is a way to enjoy eating vegetables for a long period after the harvest is over. In the past, pickled vegetables of every kind were found in almost every home in the Middle East and many other countries around the world. People make pickles of any type of seasonal vegetables. Many get creative in the methods and ingredients used for pickling. Many of these pickling recipes were handed down from one generation to another.*  

*Most of us are familiar with pickled olives, eggplants, cucumbers, cauliflower, cabbage, chilies, lemons, beets, carrots, and many other vegetables. Some pickles are not familiar to us but with trying them out we develop a taste for them and like them. Spices, herbs, oils and other additions are used in pickling, and these differ from one country to another which gives the vegetables their own special flavor. The flavors depend on the country, weather, and fresh produce available at the time of pickling too.*

*Most of the time in the Levant, pickles are used as a condiment, served with many different foods and main dishes during lunch and dinner meals. Pickles add a lot of nice tangy flavor to any sandwich, such as Shawerma or Falafel, and it is preferred by many of us -- to some people it is a must have item to complete any meal or sandwich.*

*This is my turnips and boiled beets pickle recipe. It is simple, easy, and fast. The most important thing is that it works out every time for me and I hope it works out for you, too, if you try it.*
