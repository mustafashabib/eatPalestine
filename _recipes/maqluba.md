*In the tradition of dishes with the most straightforward name possible, Maqluba means "Upside Down". Traditionally, Maqluba is made with chicken or lamb though here I've kept it vegetarian. The layers of crunchy cauliflower, creamy eggplants and tomatoes, crunchy nuts, and rice combine to create a decadent mix of flavors and textures that are worth the effort.*

#### Recipe

1. Soak the rice in cold water for at least 15 minutes.
2. Break the cauliflower head into individual florets.
3. Remove the stem from the eggplant and slice into thin disks. Salt the disks and let them drain in a colander.
4. Heat the oil in a deep pan.
5. Fry the cauliflower in batches until the tops are golden brown. You can also drizzle with oil and roast in the oven at 450°F for 30 minutes if you prefer.
6. Fry the eggplant in batches, turning over each disk as necessary until golden on both sides.
7. Finely dice the onions.
8. With the remaining oil, sautée the onions.
9. Crush the garlic cloves and add to the onions.
10. Add all of the spices to the mixture of onions and garlic.
11. 
2. Fry the noodles in one tablespoon of oil until golden and set aside.
3. Heat the remaining oil in a pot and lightly sauté the rice for a few minutes.
4. Add the salt and water and bring to a boil, uncovered. If you'd like to make yellow rice, add about two teaspoons of turmeric at this point as well.
5. Reduce the heat to low, add the noodles, and cover. Let the rice cook without stirring until the crust forms, usually around 15 minutes.
6. Let the rice sit, covered, for 10 minutes before serving. If you're bold, invert the pot onto a large dish and lift the pot slowly to get a "casserole" of rice.
