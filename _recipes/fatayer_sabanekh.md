### Fatayer Sabanekh
#### Spinach Pies

*Fattayer are similar to saffayeh only typically closed up  around the filling instead of remaining open. These here are filled with spinach, onions, lemon juice, and sumac and work as a light snack or appetizer. For a heartier variation, use potatoes, peas, onions, black pepper, and allspice for the filling instead.*

##### Ingredients
###### Makes about 24 pies

* Basic dough
  - 1 batch
* Fresh spinach
  - 2 lbs
* Yellow onion
  - 2 medium
* Extra virgin olive oil
  - 1/4 cup
* Fresh lemon juice
  - Two large lemons, or about 1/2 cup of lemon juice
* Sumac
  - 2 tablespoon
* Cumin
  - 1 tablespoon
* Salt
  - 1 tablespoon
* Black pepper
  - 1 teaspoon

##### Recipe
1. Make a batch of dough (see the **Ajeenah** recipe).
2. Preheat your oven to 450Â° F.
3. Dice the onions and roughly chop the spinach.
5. Combine into a large bowl with the lemon juice and all of the spices and let it sit for about 10 minutes.
6. Cut the dough into two inch rolls and let them rest for 10 or 15 minutes.
7. Spread each ball out with your fingers individually and place about two teaspoons to a tablespoon of the spinach mixture in the center. Fold the edges over into a triangle shape and pinch them together so they stick.
8. Place each pie in a large oiled baking pan. When you've made all the pies that will fit, bake them for about 15 minutes until the dough is puffy but not too crispy.
9. Let them cool for about 10 minutes before serving.
