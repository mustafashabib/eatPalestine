### Fattoush
#### Mixed Salad With Pita Chips And Sumac Dressing

* I go back and forth between declaring fattoush or tabbouleh the "King of All Salads", though fattoush definitely takes more effort having so many more ingredients. Try extra hard to get fresh purslane as it is a key ingredient in making this salad taste the way that it should.*

##### Ingredients
###### Makes 6 servings

* Romaine lettuce
  -  1 head
* Tomatoes
  - 2 medium
* English or Persian cucumbers
  - 2 small Persian or 1 large English cucumber
* Radishes
  - 2 or 3 bulbs
* Green onion
  - 5 sprigs
* Fresh mint and flat leaf parsley
  - A few sprigs
* Fresh garlic
  - One clove
* Fresh lemon juice
  - 2 large lemons or roughly 1/2 cup
* Pita bread
  - 1 loaf
* Extra virgin olive oil
  - 1/2 cup
* Salt
  - 1 teaspoon
* Sumac
  - 1 tablespoon

##### Recipe

1. Peel the cucumbers and finely dice them and the tomatoes.
2. Thinly slice the radishes.
3. Finely chop the green onion and the herbs.
4. Combine the cut vegetables all together in a large bowl.
5. Cut the pita into chips and fry them until they turn crispy. Add them to the vegetables once they're cool.
6. For the dressing, combine the lemon juice, olive oil, crushed garlic, sumac, and salt and whisk them all together.
7. Dress the salad right before serving. If you have leftovers, save the dressing and salad separately to keep the vegetables and pita chips crisp.
