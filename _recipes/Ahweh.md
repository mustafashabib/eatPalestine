### Ahweh

#### Coffee

*In the Middle East, you'll be offered an option to order the coffee one of three ways: **saddah** (black, no sugar), **wasat** (medium) - a reasonable amount of sugar, and **hilweh** (sweet) - an incredible amount of sugar. My grandpa likes it so sweet the he always has to get his coffee made separate. The coffee is served in low demitasse cups and, if you want a little fun, can be turned over after drinking to read your future in the images left behind by the grounds.*

##### Ingredients

-	Ground Coffee
	-	1 teaspoon per cup of coffee
-	Sugar (optional)
	-	1 teaspoon per cup of coffee for medium sweetness.
-	Ground cardamom
	-	A pinch per cup of coffee. Roughly 1/8 teaspoon per 4 cups, but add more or less to your liking.
-	Water
	-	As needed

##### Recipe

1.	Measure the water to put in the pot - one demitasse cup of water per cup you wish to prepare.
2.	Add the sugar, coffee, and cardamom, stir, and heat it to a rolling boil.
3.	Watch the kettle very carefully, it has a tendency to boil over very quickly. When you see it foaming up and about to spill over, take it off of the heat to let it settle down, then add it back to the heat. Repeat this cycle of heating and removing the kettle from the heat until the foam dissipates.
4.	Take the kettle off of the heat and let it sit for a minute so that the grounds settle to the bottom before serving.
