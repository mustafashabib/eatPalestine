### Salatah Arabeeya
#### Jerusalem Salad

*This is a simple salad that I grew up eating at what seemed like nearly every dinner. Like most salads in this book, you can stuff it in a sandwich, serve it with rice, or eat it all on its own. Often, we'd make it without tahini, so you can skip it if you want something a bit lighter.*

##### Ingredients
###### Makes enough for a few people

* English or Persian cucumbers
    - 2 small Persian or 1 large English cucumber
* Tomatoes
    - 2 medium
* Fresh mint
    - A few sprigs
* Fresh lemon juice
    - One large lemon or roughly 1/4 cup
* Tahini (optional)
    - 2 teaspoon
* Salt
    - 1/4 teaspoon
* Extra virgin olive oil        
    - 1 tablespoon

##### Recipe
1. Peel and dice the cucumbers, sprinkle with salt, and let them drain a little bit.
2. Finely dice the tomatoes and herbs.
3. Mince the garlic if you are using any.
4. Mix everything together in a bowl and let it stand for a half hour or so before serving.
