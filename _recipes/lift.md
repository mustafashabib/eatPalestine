*Pickling is one way to preserve many types of seasonal vegetables and enjoy them off season. Preservatives used such as salt, vinegar,acetic acid, boiled water, cold water, boiling of the vegetables or just pickling them raw, these are endless choices when it comes to the preserving process. Also pickling has been used before refrigeration was invented, it is a way to enjoy eating vegetables for a long period of time after the harvest time is over.In the past, pickled vegetables of every kind were found in almost every home in the Middle East and many other countries around the world.

#### Recipe

_Note: 2:1 Ratio of white vinegar to water is always used, does not matter how big or small your jar is. About one Tablespoon Salt for a 16 oz jar, you may use less for smaller jars and more for bigger jars. Trust me, it works!_

1.  Peel and boil the beets. Save some of the water to add to the pickling jar.
2.  Cut the turnips and the boiled beets into quarters. 
3.  Add the vinegar, water and salt.
